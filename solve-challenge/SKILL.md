description: Solves CTF challenges by performing first-pass triage, identifying the dominant category, and routing execution to the right specialized ctf-* skill. Use when the user gives you a challenge bundle, a remote service, a suspicious file, or only a vague challenge description and you must determine where to start. Do not use it when the category is already clear and a specialized skill can be invoked directly; this is the dispatcher and recon entrypoint, not the deepest reference for category-specific techniques.

compatibility: Requires filesystem-based agent (Claude Code or similar) with bash, Python 3, and internet access. Orchestrates other ctf-* skills.

# CTF Challenge Solver

## Workflow

### Step 1: Recon

1. List the challenge directory, run `file *` on everything
2. Triage binaries: `strings`, `xxd | head`, `binwalk`, `checksec`
3. Fetch URLs mentioned in the challenge FIRST for context
4. Connect to remote services (`nc`) to understand what they expect
5. Read challenge descriptions, filenames, and comments for clues

### Step 2: Categorize

Determine the primary category, then invoke the matching skill.

**By file type:**
- `.pcap`, `.pcapng`, `.evtx`, `.raw`, `.dd`, `.E01` -> forensics
- `.elf`, `.exe`, `.so`, `.dll`, binary with no extension -> reverse or pwn (check if remote service provided -- if yes, likely pwn)
- `.py`, `.sage`, `.txt` with numbers -> crypto
- `.apk`, `.wasm`, `.pyc` -> reverse
- Web URL or source code with HTML/JS/PHP/templates -> web
- Images, audio, PDFs with no obvious content -> forensics (steganography)

**By challenge description keywords:**
- "buffer overflow", "ROP", "shellcode", "libc", "heap" -> pwn
- "RSA", "AES", "cipher", "encrypt", "prime", "modulus", "lattice", "LWE", "GCM" -> crypto
- "XSS", "SQL", "injection", "cookie", "JWT", "SSRF" -> web
- "disk image", "memory dump", "packet capture", "registry", "stego" -> forensics
- "find", "locate", "identify", "who", "where" -> osint
- "obfuscated", "packed", "C2", "malware", "beacon" -> malware
- "jail", "sandbox", "escape", "encoding", "signal", "game" -> misc

**By service behavior:**
- Port with interactive prompt, crash on long input -> pwn
- HTTP service -> web
- netcat with math/crypto puzzles -> crypto
- netcat with restricted shell or eval -> misc (jail)

### Step 3: Invoke the Category Skill

| Category | Invoke | When to Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Web | `/ctf-web` | XSS, SQLi, SSTI, SSRF, JWT, file uploads, prototype pollution |
| Pwn | `/ctf-pwn` | Buffer overflow, format string, heap, ROP, sandbox escape |
| Crypto | `/ctf-crypto` | RSA, AES, ECC, PRNG, ZKP, classical ciphers |
| Reverse | `/ctf-reverse` | Binary analysis, game clients, VMs, obfuscated code |
| Forensics | `/ctf-forensics` | Disk images, memory dumps, event logs, stego, network captures |
| OSINT | `/ctf-osint` | Social media, geolocation, DNS, public records |
| Malware | `/ctf-malware` | Obfuscated scripts, C2 traffic, PE/.NET analysis |
| Misc | `/ctf-misc` | Jails, encodings, RF/SDR, esoteric languages, constraint solving |

### Step 4: Pivot When Stuck

1. Re-examine assumptions -- Is this really the category you think?
2. Try a different category skill -- many challenges span multiple categories
3. Look for what you missed -- hidden files, alternate ports, response headers, comments in source, metadata in images
4. Simplify -- check for default creds, known CVE, logic bug
5. Check edge cases -- off-by-one, race conditions, integer overflow, encoding mismatches

### Step 5: Generate Write-up

After solving, invoke `/ctf-writeup` to generate a standardized submission-style writeup.

## Flag Formats

Common formats: `flag{...}`, `FLAG{...}`, `CTF{...}`, `TEAM{...}`. Custom prefixes vary by CTF -- check the challenge description or CTF rules.

```bash
# Search for common flag patterns in files
grep -rniE '(flag|ctf|eno|htb|pico)\{' .
# Search in binary/memory output
strings output.bin | grep -iE '\{.*\}'
```

If multiple flag-like strings found, treat them as candidates and validate before finalizing.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Recon
file *                                    # Identify file types
strings binary | grep -i flag             # Quick string search
xxd binary | head -20                     # Hex dump header
binwalk -e firmware.bin                   # Extract embedded files
checksec --file=binary                    # Check binary protections

# Connect
nc host port                              # Connect to challenge
echo -e "answer1\nanswer2" | nc host port # Scripted input
curl -v http://host:port/                 # HTTP recon

# Python exploit template
python3 -c "
from pwn import *
r = remote('host', port)
r.interactive()
"
```
